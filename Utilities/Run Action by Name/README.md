# Run Action by Name

This StreamerBot Action allows you to run Actions based on the value in a variable.
Set the name of the Action in the "runActionName" variable and then run this Action if it exists.
If there was an Action with the name specified then the "runActionResult" will equal true, otherwise it will 
be false.
